## About

I like burgers. And I like to know where the best ones are in my area at all times. So, I build a Ruby application to do that.

The Ruby objects for each restaurant are scraped using Nokigiri from the webpage [The 15 Best Places for Burgers in Baltimore](https://foursquare.com/top-places/baltimore/best-places-burgers). Details on a specific restaurant is displayed based on a selection from the user.

My blog post [CLI Have No Idea What I‚Äôm Doing: Planning (and Building) My First CLI Application](https://shannoncrabill.com/blog/cli-application-planning/) goes into detail on the steps I took to make this happen.

A static version of the webpage is included in the `fixture` file to prevent any time out or repeated request errors.

- The CLI will ask you for you name and present a list of 15 burger joints in the Batimore area.
